        The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation
        involves packing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Florence, Italy</h2>
      <>
        A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes,
        sculptures, churches, palaces, and other monuments from the richest
        cultural flowering the world has known. Names from its dazzling
        historical past; Dante, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelliare are some
        of the most resonant of the medieval age. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Learn More.</a>

      <h2>2. Beijing, China</h2>
      <p>
        A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the
        success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied
        construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to
        spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples
        Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures
        of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view in the famed
        Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer
        Palace. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Learn More.</a>

      <h2>3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
      <p>
        The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates
        squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han
        River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city center
        complete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples
        nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for
        sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny
        neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of
        identical apartments. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Learn More.</a>
